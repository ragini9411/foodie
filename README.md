# **foodie**
***this is my final project-***
This project is about a foodie website where A web application that I have deployed using Azure is a collection of the best-known foods,
which is the stuff of every foodie's dreams. Food enthusiasts can learn a lot about various cuisines and express their opinions using my application.
Food blogging is a component of food journalism that connects a passion for gourmet cuisine with blog writing and food photography.
Food blogs are typically authored by food enthusiasts, also known as "foodies," and they can be utilised by the blogger for commercial purposes to make money. 
Our application give these people a platform.

***Process-***
first developed the web-application in visual studio code and then pushed the code in the github repo
then in azure formed a resourse group and then using azure i developed the web application.the application was deployed successfully
